# Deployment of the SpECTRE code

This repository deploys
[sxs-collaboration/spectre](https://github.com/sxs-collaboration/spectre) to the
Docker container
[nilsleiffischer/spectre-deploy](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/nilsleiffischer/spectre-deploy).
You can create a [GitHub Codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/about-codespaces)
from this repository to jump right into an environment where SpECTRE is built
and installed. For example, once you have created the Codespace, open the
`Walkthrough.ipynb` notebook to explore some of SpECTRE's functionality.
